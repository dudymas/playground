The Basics
----------

::

    let language: String = "Swift"
    var version: Double = 1.0
    let introduced: Int = 2014
    let is_awesome: Bool = true

 - var keyword to declare variables
 - : to indicate type
 - type inferenced
 - let keyword for costs
 - immutability (costs) prefered by "default" only opt into vars
 - safer in multithreaded environments, can be optimized
 - unicode supported for symbol names
 - Swift String similar to NSString
 - for in loop for iterating over collection of chars (String)::

    for character in "this smells like python" {
        println(character)
    }

 - characters are their own type
 - chars and strigns support + for concatenation
 - string formatting::

    let a = 3, b = 5
    let result = "\(a) times \(b) is \(a * b)"

 - strings are immutable
 - Arrays and Dictionaries are similar to NSArray/NSDictionary
 - Array and Dict literals::

    var strings = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
    var mapping = ["test": 5, "this": 4, "out": 2]
